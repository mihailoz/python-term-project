# Python Term Project - Turism agency

## About

A simple python3 program with SQLite3 database to simulate inserting and searching hotels, rooms, services...

## How to setup

Run create_database.sql under sqlite3 on a database with the name example.db

Currently 'example.db' string is hardcoded in all Python scripts that connect to the database.
I didn't make this more flexible as it was not requested as a requirement for my term project.

I will NOT be improving this project further, as of right now.
